`eemd_example` is a simple example program for the C interface of libeemd. It
writes its output to `eemd_example.out`. If you have installed `pyeemd` you can
plot the results with the Python script `eemd_example_plot.py`. To compile the
example please run `make`.
make sure the library (libeemd.so) in the parent directory was already compiled.
